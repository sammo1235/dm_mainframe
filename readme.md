#  Dunder Mifflin Mainframe

Can you hack the mainframe and unlock Michael's safe using your knowledge of Ruby?

## The target

Your ultimate goal is to unlock the encrypted and passphrase protected file named "quote.txt.gpg".
To do this, you'll need to retrieve and decrypt Michael's password from the user database.

You'll need to have installed gpg beforehand to decrypt the file.

## Rules

You can read all of the source code, but you cannot edit it.
You must only enter commands in the provided repl.
Copy and paste if you must, but it's harder without.

To start, clone the repo and run 

```
$ ruby mainframe.rb
```

Good luck!
